## Features
- Add student details (Name, Roll No, Marks in 5 subjects)
- Calculate total marks and percentage
- Assign grade based on percentage
- Display all students
- Menu-driven system for easy navigation

4. Assign grade based on percentage:
   - 90–100 → A
   - 80–89 → B
   - 70–79 → C
   - 60–69 → D
   - Below 60 → F
5. Display all students with total, percentage, and grade.
